#Transformed-Gradient

This is tensorflow implementation for paper "Boosting Adversarial Attacks with Transformed Gradient"

We propose a Transformed Gradient method (TG), which consists of three steps: orignial gradient accumulation, gradient amplification and 
gradient truncation. This method achieves higher attack success rate with less perturbations. Meanwhile, we introduce the Frechet Inception 
Distance(FID) (codes see [here](https://github.com/toshas/torch-fidelity))and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity(LPIPS)(codes see [here](https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity)) 
respectively to evaluate fidelity and perceived distance from the original image, which is more comprehensive than only using L_\infty norm as evaluation metrics.

## Sample
Our proposed method achieves higher attack success rate with less perturbations.
The noises of adversarial examples generated by our proposed method are less visible than that generated by baseline.
